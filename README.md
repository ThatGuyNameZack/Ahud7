# Ahud7
# A combination of Ahud and 7HUD
# this hud is still on development, which means they are still broken stuff in the hud
#example some console commands can break the hud like "hud_reloadshceme" it will break the scoreboard (haven't find the fix yet)

# if you try to remove the huds custom crosshair go to Ahud7/scripts/hudlayout when you go through there edit it with notepad (notepad++ is far more recommended)
# find this specific texts "FogCrosshair" And "KnucklesCrosses" and disable the "visible" by turn the "1" to "0"
