# Ahud7
> A combination of Ahud and 7HUD
> this hud is still on development, which means there are still broken stuff in the hud
> example some console commands can break the hud like "hud_reloadshceme" it will break the scoreboard (haven't find the fix yet)
> here this is the picture [https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/771736215577194024/306D6BBFAC030B49362D77791182A7AB3319FFA1/]

> if you try to remove the huds custom crosshair go to Ahud7/scripts/hudlayout when you go through there edit it with notepad (notepad++ is more recommended)
> find this specific texts "FogCrosshair" And "KnucklesCrosses" and disable the "visible" by turn the "1" to "0"
